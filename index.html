      <img src="assets/images/profile.jpeg" class="auth-image" alt="Corey Main">

      <p>I have a passion for serving people through effective communication, education/training, and creative, thoughtful business solutions. 

      <p>For 12 years, I have been a customer service/communications professional in insurance, higher education, IT, and hospitality. During that time, I served as a departmental resource in property and casualty claims, a team lead for process and systems analysis and project communications, and a business development manager. I recently graduated with honors from my MBA program with an emphasis in Human Resource Management. Currently, I provide expert quality service via phone, e-mail, chat, video conference, and/or in-person as a freelancer, and remain dedicated to professional development through education, training, as well as work and volunteer opportunities.

      <p>I am actively pursuing permanent opportunities with quality organizations that will challenge me to grow professionally. I am interested in roles that will utilize my skills in communications, problem-solving, and technology.

      <p>Please check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and be sure to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> and connect with me via social media!
